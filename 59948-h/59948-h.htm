<p>Chances are that the effect of the
tranquilizer bulletin in the last
Green Thumb has worn off. We can
now carefully appraise the damage
done to our trees. On streets where
brush removal has been completed, it
is easy to see that many trees, though
battered and misshapen, are not a
total loss. Now that the leaves have
fallen, split crotches and stubs left in
emergency removals are much in evidence.
Our previous bulletin mentioned
that there was no rush in doing
this type of repair work, as long as it
is completed by the time growth starts
in the spring.</p>
<p>This final repair work, for the most
part, should be done by a professional
tree surgeon. Sawing off a limb isn&rsquo;t
quite as easy as falling off a log. First
of all, in large trees the danger of falling
is a major hazard for the amateur.
Secondly, improper pruning can be
quite detrimental to the future growth
of the tree.</p>
<p>Under normal conditions we have
enough good tree men to adequately
take care of our trees. This storm,
however, has put a great burden on
the existing tree companies and has
opened a tempting field to a lot of unqualified
and unscrupulous people.
These persons, armed with a pick-up,
a ladder and a saw, can ruin a good
tree in an hour&rsquo;s time. Don&rsquo;t be afraid
to ask for credentials; a legitimate operator
will gladly produce them, and
recommendations if necessary. Above
all, if you are not sure of his qualifications,
watch his work for the mistakes
explained and illustrated in this
article.</p>
<p>To know a good pruning job from
a bad one it is necessary to understand
a few principles of tree growth. First
of all, a tree, like all plants, is a living
organism. We know that it manufactures
its own food in the leaves. Raw
materials, water and minerals, taken
in by the roots are transported up to
the leaves and there, in the presence
of sunlight and chlorophyll (green
matter), are converted to simple food.
These in turn flow back through the
tree, nourishing growing cells throughout
the plant. This intricate transportation
system and a layer of active
growth cells lie just beneath the bark.
There are a number of theories on the
forces that put this system into motion.
However, for our purposes it is evident
that the foliage of the tree is essential
to this process. It stands to
reason then that we can&rsquo;t just lop off
all the major branches of a large tree
and expect it to survive.</p>

<p>Granted that in some cases pruning
will have to be severe, but if it is done
properly the tree will have a chance to
live. When a large branch is cut off
and a stub is left, the growth processes
stop in the projected stub, but continue
their natural course of flow at
its base in the parent branch. Each year
as the tree grows it builds up a new
growth ring around the stub. This is
noted as a swelling, and will continue
to grow in size each succeeding year.
In the meantime, the dead stub is exposed
to the elements and begins to
rot away. In time it will decay back
to the stem or trunk and be sloughed
off and the original wound may close
over with new growth rings. Usually
before this happens, the organisms
causing decay of the stub enter the
main stem and begin their slow but
deadly work there, so that in time the
entire tree may become decadent.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the limb is
cut back flush to the parent limb or
stem, we find that the sap flow and
growth ring still occur around the
wound, but that each succeeding year
the ring occurs inside the cut area. In
time this growth will completely enclose
the wound. On a small wound
of an inch diameter this sealing may
take place in several years&rsquo; time.
Larger cuts will, of course, take more
time and to prevent decay while they
are healing a good tree paint should
be applied to seal the wound until
natural growth heals it over.</p>
<p>In addition to eliminating the stubs,
other repairs might have to be made.
In some cases the branches broke at
their point of attachment on the parent
limb and have peeled back the bark,
leaving a jagged and irregular shaped
wound. As indicated above, the new
growth follows the easiest and smoothest
path so that in such cases the
wound needs to be shaped to allow
for the quickest possible healing. From
experience it has been found that a
vertical elongated oval is the quickest
to heal over, as it follows, as close as
possible, the natural flow of material
in a plant. This method is illustrated
in the accompanying sketches.</p>
<p>Another repair that may be necessary
is the cabling and bolting of split
or weakened crotches. This is based
on engineering principles and should
be attempted only by an experienced
arborist. The sketch on <a href="#Page_331">page 331</a>
shows one application of this method.</p>
<p>As mentioned in our tranquilizer
bulletin, our trees have had a good
growing year, and with proper care
this winter, can come back quickly in
the spring.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">Tax Deduction for Trees Lost in Storms</span></h2>
<p class="center"><i>From The Shade Tree Digest</i></p>
<p>Were any of your fine shade trees wrecked by the September snowstorm?
If so, a bit of foresight and effort on your part now may result in considerable
savings to you when the time comes to pay your 1959 Federal income tax.
For, usually, residential property is more valuable with trees than without, and
if the value of that property is lessened as a result of storms the amount of the
tangible loss is deductible in computing income tax returns.</p>
<p>Any loss claimed must be based upon material value. A tree may become
&ldquo;almost like a member of the family&rdquo; in your esteem&mdash;but don&rsquo;t use that
approach if you have occasion to evaluate it as &ldquo;deductible loss!&rdquo; However
much Government tax officials might agree with you in sentiment, they are permitted
to measure the worth of a tree only by its effect upon the market price
of the &ldquo;real estate&rdquo;&mdash;including land, buildings and other trees&mdash;of which it
is an integral part.</p>
<p>Relative to computing the amount of deductible loss, the Bureau of
Internal Revenue advises as follows: (1) The &ldquo;apparent loss&rdquo; of property is
the difference between the fair market values of the property immediately before
and immediately after the casualty. (2) Compare the &ldquo;apparent loss&rdquo; with
the adjusted basis of the property. (3) The &ldquo;loss sustained&rdquo; is the apparent
loss, or the adjusted basis, whichever is the lesser. (4) From the loss sustained
subtract the amount, if any, of insurance or other recovery. (5) The balance
remaining is the &ldquo;loss recognized&rdquo; for income tax purposes.</p>
<p>Thus, computing the amount of the &ldquo;loss&rdquo; hinges upon determination of
&ldquo;fair market values,&rdquo; and, unfortunately, there is no exact mathematical formula
by which this can be ascertained. Clearly, any &ldquo;loss&rdquo; claims should be supported
by positive evidence. Such evidence might include photographs, and
certainly reports from experts in the particular fields involved in the loss.</p>
<p>Shade trees certainly add to the value of a property. If one is destroyed
by a storm, measuring the extent of loss to the property is a matter requiring
technical knowledge and good judgment. The value of a tree is affected by
species, age, condition, location and other factors, and to arrive at an estimate
which will survive close scrutiny by tax officials all pertinent factors must be
considered. Data intended for use in support of a loss claim should be gathered,
of course, as soon as possible after the casualty.</p>
<p>Further tree damage can be expected from ice storms in the months ahead.
If any of your trees have been, or are, lost from such &ldquo;natural physical forces&rdquo;
it will pay you to remember that their value&mdash;at least, for tax purposes&mdash;can
be measured in dollars-and-cents.</p>

<p>1. Shop early enough so that you&rsquo;ll
be able to choose a variety of both
traditional and brightly colored foil
and printed foil wraps. Don&rsquo;t neglect
to select some of the convenient cutter
box papers and the king size fold
holiday papers that make wrapping a
large gift so simple.</p>
<p>2. Give each package a character
of its own by selecting a paper to
suit its size or to complement the
personality of the recipient.</p>
<p>3. Select ribbon or additional package
decorations to complement your
package. Small boxes require a more
subtle patterned paper than a larger
size package.</p>
<p>4. To make the job a little more
organized keep all wrapping supplies
including scissors and cellophane tape
together in a large box. After these
preliminary preparations select a
large enough work area, assemble
your materials and start wrapping.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Mrs. Provinzano with her display of dolls and
curios at the Colorado State Fair.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Shiny red apples on the grocer&rsquo;s
shelves beam their way into the
shopper&rsquo;s basket as a focal point in an
autumn table arrangement before they
become the ingredients of a festive
mealtime table delicacy, or so I
thought until I met the &ldquo;apple doll
lady&rdquo; at the recent Colorado State
Fair.</p>
<p>Standing beneath the traditional
emblem of the Red Cross, and clad
in the costume of a Gray Lady, Mrs.
Attie (Nick) Provinzano, radiated
good cheer as she greeted the visitors
that paused to view her display of
curio-oddities within the glass showcase.</p>
<p>She extended her hand in welcome
as I approached and we were soon
oblivious to those about us as we renewed
and reviewed old acquaintanceship
and activities.</p>
<p>I remembered her as a Corona Park
Garden Club member, when we returned
to Pueblo during the depression
days, for I had been fascinated
by her verve and stamina. Though
mother of five children, she was an
active P.T.A. worker (for 19 years)
and the dynamo that sparked the enthusiasm
of her chosen garden club,
organizing and directing a Hill Billy
Band with great gusto. They presented
programs in the city and surrounding
areas, and derived greatest
pleasure from entertaining shut-ins.</p>
<p>Unable to read a musical note she
developed her own system of teaching
others to play the harmonica (she
played in the band) and the accordion;
thus revealing the rugged individualism,
natural instincts, quick
thinking, determination and consideration
for others that was so pronounced
in both Kit Carson and Tom Tobin,
her great-grandfathers.</p>
<p>These intervening years hadn&rsquo;t dimmed
her enthusiasm for meeting and
helping people, it seemed, and I listened
intently as she shared her knowledge
of fashioning doll heads from
various fruits; apples, peaches or
pears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What started you on this hobby?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandmother in Germany sent
me an 100 year old apple doll and I
planned to keep it clean, so I placed
a glass jar over it. It soon disintegrated
and I was heartsick about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old were you then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, about 10. My mother dried
my tears when she suggested we go
into the orchard to find an apple and
<span class="pb" id="Page_336">336</span>
thought I might be able to reproduce
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you begin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By peeling the apple and setting it
aside to dry, but pinching the features
in during this drying process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you use for teeth?&rdquo; a
bystander asked.</p>
<p>Mrs. Provinzano smiled as she said,
&ldquo;Lima beans, and see what I make of
the skins of the lima beans, small artificial
rose buds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation became more animated
as others questioned her. She
explained that apples shrink to one
half or one third their original size
during the drying period and this gives
the appearance of wrinkled skin. She
devised a scheme to overcome the
wrinkles and gently massaged cold
cream into the apple doll. &ldquo;It takes
three weeks for it to dry into wrinkled
features and it takes three weeks to
massage those wrinkles out, for all
time.&rdquo; The apple heads retain the soft
texture indefinitely, for they pick up
enough moisture from the air to retain
the texture, but not enough to rot.
These heads are mounted on sticks,
i.e., clothespins, and inserted into bottles.
These are draped with a dress
or tunic suitable for the subject, thus
eliminating the need for making a
body or wire base.</p>
<p>A mask fashioned from half a
grapefruit and one of an orange were
pointed out. She cautioned would-be
hobbyists against using a knife to define
the features, as the acid in the
fruit rots the knife (metal) incisions.
Toothpicks should be used for this
procedure. Wall paper cleaner is used
for the clay to fill the scooped out
citrus fruit, pinching in the nose,
punching out the eyes and mouth with
toothpicks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about this Nun doll&rsquo;s head?
It&rsquo;s very pale compared to the apple
doll&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re fashioned of hard and
dry marshmallows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you fashion the features?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I use an emery board to hollow
out the depressions. I save all the
powder that falls during this process
and mix it with rouge and gently rub
it into the cheeks for a bit of color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they need a protective coating
to keep them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I learned by trial and error,
for one doll was sent to India and the
ants got at it, so I instructed them to
send the head back to me and I&rsquo;d
make up another in exchange. The
coating of shellac preserved it, even
from the ants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this jewelry made of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of it&rsquo;s made of bubble gum.
I neglected to coat it with a preservative
when I first learned to fashion
flowers from it, and one day in summer
I could feel the earring lengthen,
so I removed it to experiment with a
coating of shellac, and it worked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Indian head looks like a wall
plaque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it&rsquo;s made of old bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old bread? I usually feed mine to
the birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens, at my house everything
is used to fashion some sort of plaque,
or doll head or picture. I soak the old
bread in a very little water then
squeeze it dry, and add about &frac14; cup
salt to 1 cup of the bread dough and
knead it. It will rise after salt has been
added, but it will eventually stop rising
and you will have a good clay to
fashion your figurines with. Take this
cowboy plaque. The plaque itself is
papier-mache, the figure of the horseman
of various materials; the upper
body of gum, the chaps of dried banana
peelings that are fashioned over
rolls of clay, the seams laced with
thread, and they dry resembling
leather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this picture of apple blossoms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s made of wall paper
cleaner. I dye portions of it and use
it for earrings and children&rsquo;s dishes
as well as for wall plaques or framed
pictures. I dilute the mixture used as
background.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dilute it? With what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water, but only to the consistency
of cream, then I cover the backing,
usually a piece of cardboard. When
that is dry I use a thicker mixture and
press a bit, about the size of my
thumb, on the prepared surface and
add more petals until I have the desired
picture. That one was made up
so that you could hang it from any
side and it would show flowering
branches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her most famous doll is the Kit
Carson doll, patented and registered
with the Doll Guild of America. The
buckskin suits are made from old
leather jackets. She carves the wooden
guns and uses the spurs from chicken
legs for the powder horns. A coon-skin
cap and a cowboy hat complete
each outfit. Although they sell for
twelve dollars, these dolls are in great
demand and there is a great backlog
of orders.</p>
<p>She believes that everyone should
have two hobbies, because a single
hobby can become monotonous. As
one alternate, she exhibits Indian belts
made from pounded out soda pop bottle
tops laced with colored yarn. She
also works down gnarled tree roots
for use as lamp stands.</p>
<p>Mrs. Provinzano has traveled thru-out
the west exhibiting her dolls,
which range from pioneer scouts to
Indians and Mexicans, at various fairs.
At the International Hobby Show in
California, some years ago, she won
a first place ribbon for &ldquo;Ingenuity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She possesses the abiding faith in
Divine guidance and protection that
<span class="pb" id="Page_338">338</span>
was her grandfather&rsquo;s, believing that
she is on this earth to help others. She
believes sharing brings its rewards, for
often a remark dropped by another
will open up a door to new achievements,
and she has an illustrious record
of achievements to her credit.</p>
<p>Records reveal that she taught
swimming for the Young Women&rsquo;s
Christian Association, hobbies and
handcrafts for the Steel Works Young
Men&rsquo;s Christian Association and devoted
many years to showing crippled
children at the St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital
pediatric ward how to generate their
own sunshine by making things with
their hands, often deformed hands that
responded slowly to determined little
minds. She also taught harmonica and
handicraft at Sacred Heart Orphanage.</p>
<p>The Provinzano home is called the
Kit Carson Rancho, part dream and
part reality, because Attie hoped some
day to acquire a mountain ranch, destined
to become a summer camp for
boys, that they may know some of
the wonders of nature, and the pleasure
of living under the stars among
the pines.</p>
<p>Whether this dream becomes a reality
remains to be seen. Though she
conquered serious injuries, she is
familiar with the shadow of bereavement;
a daughter, some years back,
and most recently, last March, the
husband who had planned to work
beside her to enjoy her worthwhile
hobbies that she now teaches to boys
at Fort Carson.</p>
<p>As for me, and her close friends,
the sight of polished apples and citrus
fruits will always be a bright reminder
of the vivacious, courageous sunshine
lady who now operates a Hobby Shop
at Beulah, Colorado.</p>

mural on the living room mirror with easily removable &ldquo;suds-snow.&rdquo; An outline drawn on the mirror
with a soap sliver or a grease pencil can be an easy guide for the young artists to follow. After the
holidays, the suds painting can be washed away with a damp cloth, leaving the mirror shining clean.</p>
</div>
<p>It&rsquo;s Christmas ... visions of sugar
plums dance in children&rsquo;s heads,
What do <i>you see</i>&mdash;too much to do
in a short time?</p>
<p>Those last-minute decorative
chores, for example. Will they send
you scurrying? You can end such
anxieties&mdash;swiftly, and easily&mdash;with
soapsuds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right&mdash;<i>soapsuds</i>! It&rsquo;s a
novel way to complete holiday projects;
glistening suds whipped up like
snow will decorate your Christmas
tree and gift boxes ... adorn your
creche ... bring three-dimensional
artwork to your mirrors and windows
... provide an effective safety valve
for your youngsters&rsquo; excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suds-snow&rdquo; not only works like
magic, it&rsquo;s as simple to produce as
rubbing Aladdin&rsquo;s lamp. All you do
is pour several cups of packaged soap
(or detergent) and a minimum of
water into a bowl. Beat with an electric
or hand mixer until suds have the
consistency of whipped cream&mdash;and
you&rsquo;re ready to decorate!</p>
<p>Start with your Christmas tree.
Realistic suds-snow will bring that
white Christmas to your evergreen&mdash;no
matter what the weather <i>outside</i>.
Using a spoon, drift some &ldquo;snow&rdquo; artistically
on the boughs of your tree.</p>
<p>If the tree is white, add vegetable
coloring while mixing your suds to
achieve a beautiful color contrast. (A
similar &ldquo;snowfall&rdquo; provides just the
right decor for the roof of your creche
and on holly and evergreen sprigs that
surround it.)</p>

stands, proudly laden with lacy golden cones,

heaping the life-like plastic boughs with suds-snow

<p class="pcap">This youngster is just bubbling over with enthusiasm for her artwork. She feels just like one of
Santa&rsquo;s helpers at the North Pole&mdash;because she&rsquo;s able, with a bowl of suds-snow and tempera paint,
to make almost all the Christmas presents for her gift list. Shown here are a stationery holder and
a pencil holder for her dad; the picture above is for mother to hang in the playroom; and the Christmas
card holder is a gift for the house!</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_341">341</div>
<p>After &ldquo;frosting&rdquo; your tree, complete
your decoration with distinctive ornaments
made from the same basic soap&mdash;but
mixed to a stiff, dough-like consistency.
For example, fill a cookie
press with these thick suds. Then
press snowflake circles or diamonds&mdash;with
holes in the middle&mdash;onto a
cookie sheet, and add glitter for a
sparkling touch. Let them dry for 24
hours and they&rsquo;re ready to be tied to
the boughs of your tree with colorful
ribbons or strings. You can also glue
them to any flat surface.</p>
<p>Versatile suds-snow comes in handy
for decorating gift packages, too. Just
wrap your presents with attractive
paper ... fill a pastry tube with medium
dense suds ... and you&rsquo;re ready
to &ldquo;draw&rdquo; any appropriate design for
the occasion&mdash;initials, messages,
snowflakes, candy cane, or what have
you. Place these on the broadest surface
of your box and accent them with
holly sprigs or miniature balls. You&rsquo;ll
find you&rsquo;ve created the most distinctive
packages under your tree!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one more happy side to the
advent of snow-suds for the Yule season.
They provide a constructive medium
for your children&mdash;a happy outlet
during your flurry of Yuletide activity.
Let them have fun decorating
the mirrors and windows of their
rooms with Christmas pictures. Armed
with no more than paint brushes and
a bowlful of thick suds, they can create
striking 3-D effects&mdash;that wash off
after the holidays easily as any soap
does, leaving your mirrors and windows
cleaner than ever!</p>
<p>Youngsters can also make Christmas
gifts from suds! One idea: a pencil
holder made from an empty frozen
juice can. First, the top has to be
removed. Then your child colors the
can, using a mixture of one teaspoon
of soap or detergent to two or three
teaspoons of tempera. This is an important
recipe because tempera paints
adhere to shiny, waxed, or metal surfaces
only when soap or detergent is
added.</p>
<p>After the paint dries, Junior or Sis
can design a suds-snow picture over
it to provide an eye-catching decoration&mdash;and
an attractive gift for any
member of the family.</p>
<p>No matter which of these refreshing
soap-suds decorations you use, remember
to let it dry for 24 hours. It
will remain bright as frost in the
moonlight for a Christmas-through-New
Year&rsquo;s decoration that brings
cheer to your holiday guests.</p>

<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">FRANKINCENSE AND MYRRH</span></h2>
<p>The Bible says that when Jesus was born in Bethlehem, &ldquo;behold, there
came wise men from the east&rdquo;. It does not say how many but tradition has it
that they were three magi or, perhaps, three kings. &ldquo;And when they were come
into the house, they saw the young child with Mary its mother, and fell down,
and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented
unto Him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of His life on earth, after the crucifixion, we are told that
Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, &ldquo;about an hundred pound
weight&rdquo;, which they placed in the linen shroud, &ldquo;as the manner of the Jews is
to bury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout the Bible, including the 37th chapter of Genesis and the 18th
of Revelations, those two exotic spices&mdash;frankincense and myrrh&mdash;are mentioned
again and again. When Jehovah spake unto Moses on Mount Sinai,
specifying how the tabernacle, the ark and the altar must be built, He also commanded
that the holy ointment should contain prescribed quantities of pure
myrrh and three other spices mixed with olive oil; further, the sacred perfume
or incense should contain equal quantities of pure frankincense and three
&ldquo;sweet spices&rdquo;.</p>
<p>These and other ordinances in the Mosaic Law were probably influenced
by customs and observances in Egypt where the Children of Israel had lived
for 430 years and Moses had grown up as a prince in Pharaoh&rsquo;s court. For
thousands of years, spices had been brought to Egypt by camel caravans from
India, Arabia and eastern Africa. From them, by secret formulas, the priests
prepared several perfumes and ointments for religious rites and domestic use.
At the feast of Isis the burnt offering was an ox, its body filled with frankincense
and myrrh. When embalming their dead, the body was filled with
myrrh, cassia and other fragrant materials, dried, wrapped in fine linen, and
placed in a painted wooden case.</p>
<p>Frankincense is a fragrant gum resin obtained from three or more of five
species of trees&mdash;<i>the Boswellias</i>&mdash;that grow in Abyssinia and Somaliland
in Africa, southern Arabia, India and the East Indies. Usually of small or
medium size, they are related to the terebinth or turpentine tree and their compound
leaves, with 7 to 9 glossy leaflets, are similar to those of a mountain ash.</p>
<p>The gum, obtained by making deep gashes in the trunk and branches,
and peeling back a few inches of bark below each cut, oozes in large white or
amber &ldquo;tears&rdquo;. After 3 or 4 months exposure they become hard and brittle, and
are collected. During handling and shipping they become covered with white
dust from rubbing against one another. They ignite readily, burn with a clear
white flame, and give off a fragrant balsam-like odor because, in addition to
resin and gum, they contain a volatile inflammable oil. The incense burned in
a censer or thurible during rituals of Roman and Greek Catholic churches is
a mixture of frankincense imported from India, Egypt and Somalia.</p>
<p>Myrrh, also a fragrant gum resin, is obtained by similar methods from
two species of shrubs or small trees that grow on rocky places in Abyssinia,
Somaliland and Arabia. Their bark and wood have a strong fragrance. The
gum, as it oozes from the stems and branches naturally or from the incisions
made, is at first a soft sticky, somewhat oily, white or yellowish brown resin
very bitter to the taste. It soon hardens into reddish-brown beads.</p>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">The Widening of Colorado Boulevard at City Park</span></h2>
<p class="center">By <span class="sc">J. Harrison Belknap</span></p>
<p>Our Association membership is indeed
interested in the highway system
within our city, and we are also interested
in the beauty of Denver and
our parks and their usefulness. The
widening and relocation of Colorado
Boulevard has been watched with interest
and we are convinced that that
important thoroughfare has been improved
greatly. But we are concerned
that in this improvement our fair city
has lost valuable park area and that
a beautiful planting of American Elms
has been destroyed. Our concern is
greatest because we fear that other
contemplated highway changes may
cut further into our dedicated park
lands.</p>
<p>In the light of the very definite interest
of the Colorado Forestry and
Horticulture Association in the welfare
of our people, and the usefulness
and beauty of the dedicated park
lands, I have been asked by the Editorial
Committee of &ldquo;The Green
Thumb&rdquo; to study and report on the
Colorado Boulevard situation and to
provide a layman&rsquo;s analysis of the legal
aspects as presented in the &ldquo;Brief of
the Plaintiff in Error&rdquo;. That brief was
presented by Mr. I. H. Kaiser, attorney
for the &ldquo;Plaintiff in Error&rdquo;, Mrs.
Madaline M. Welch.</p>
<p>First of all, as I see it, I should provide
some background for the Colorado
Boulevard project. This I will
do. It is known that the State Department
of Highways has had a right-of-way
through the city for Colorado
Boulevard. That right-of-way embraces
land that has been a part of
City Park and land that, to all intents
and purposes, has been a part of the
private properties abutting on the
boulevard. It was decided by the
State Department of Highways to realign
the boulevard and in the widening
to cut largely from the park area
on the west, or park, side of the
thoroughfare, and to use only a small
portion of the right-of-way on the
east side of the boulevard, opposite
City Park. On the basis of that decision
all of the right-of-way land on
the City Park side would be used for
the realigned and widened highway,
and an additional 17 feet of dedicated
park land would also be used. This
means that a total width of 35 feet
would be taken from City Park. On
the other hand, the right-of-way strip
on the east and private property side
to the street edge of the then existing
sidewalk only would be required for
the proposed realigned and widened
street. Our City Council agreed to this
decision and set up two enabling ordinances.
In addition it was agreed,
in a somewhat inconclusive interpolation,
that the city would be given eight
thousand dollars for the dedicated
park land taken, or to provide new
trees to compensate for those that
would be destroyed as a result of the
widening of the boulevard. Now, we
are all aware that the realignment and
widening of the boulevard has been
accomplished, and we know that dedicated
park land has been taken from
City Park.</p>
<p>In the initial court action the plaintiff
asked for temporary and permanent
restraint to prevent the use of
dedicated park land for other than
park purposes. But at the suggestion
of the court, she agreed to refrain from
pressing her motion for a preliminary
injunction, with the understanding that
the issues raised by her motion could
be dealt with at once at the trial. The
defendant agreed not to permit construction
on the dedicated park land
<span class="pb" id="Page_346">346</span>
until after trial, or without giving the
plaintiff sufficient advance notice to
enable her to call the motion for a
preliminary injunction for hearing.</p>
<p>The trial was in open court. After
due deliberation, the court decided the
ordinances of the City Council of the
City and County of Denver to be consistent
with the trust empowered upon
the Council to preserve dedicated park
land within the borders of Denver.
The defendants were then authorized
to proceed with the widening of Colorado
Boulevard utilizing dedicated
park land as proposed.</p>
<p>Suit was appealed to the Supreme
Court of the State of Colorado by Mrs.
Madaline M. Welch, &ldquo;Plaintiff in Error&rdquo;,
against the City and County of
Denver and the State Highway Commission
of the State of Colorado to
have the ordinances declared null and
void on the grounds that City Council
did not have the authority to take
dedicated park land for other than
park purposes under existing statutes
and common law.</p>
<p>The further allegations of the plaintiff
were that the greatest good for the
greatest number of people as well as
the public health, welfare and safety
were not being served by the ordinances,
and that the ordinances violated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. The basic City Planning concept
of the preservation of dedicated
park land;</p>
<p>b. the inviolability of dedicated
park land; and</p>
<p>c. the consideration of available
and reasonable alternates which
should have been investigated
before consideration was given
to the encroachment upon dedicated
park land.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plaintiff has contended in the
Supreme Court that error was committed
in the Lower Court, and that
the judgment given by that court
should be reversed. It was stated in
the brief that ordinances by City
Council under the present charter did
not have legal standing and that work
should have been delayed until there
had been a decision by the electorate
of the City and County of Denver.</p>
<p>A point made by the plaintiff is that
the City Council may not, according
to the City Charter, sell or lease land
dedicated to park purposes. And it
was then contended that the action by
City Council was, to all intents and
purposes, a sale or lease. On the
other hand, the defendant claimed that
an easement only had been granted.
It is understood that the City bargained
with the State Highway Department
and was to receive eight
thousand dollars, which sum was a
consideration in return for the City
granting the additional land, or an interest
in the land, to the State Highway
Department for use as a thoroughfare.
It appears also, as mentioned in
the foregoing, that this amount may
be used to purchase nursery stock to
compensate for the loss of the two
rows of American Elms.</p>
<p>As said before, we, as citizens of
Denver, are vitally interested in our
city and its services, including the
thoroughfares, and we hope that the
beauty of our parks and their usefulness
can be maintained, and even bettered.
We do not want to stand in
the way of progress, but we are concerned
that the action on Colorado
Boulevard at City Park may constitute
a precedent for similar violations of
dedicated park land. We fear that our
lovely Berkeley Park area and its lake
will be reduced to but a small segment
of its present size if presently considered
plans are carried out. We respectfully
appeal to the people of our
fair city to be on guard against actions
which do not consider all alternatives
and which emphasize improvement
in the arterial highway scheme,
and which may tend to disregard the
usefulness and beauty of our dedicated
park lands.</p>

<p class="revint">Question: I recently received a potted
azalea plant as a gift; can you give
me some pointers on how to care
for it?</p>
<p class="revint">Answer: Azaleas prefer a cool place,
but must have some sun. They like
to be kept moist, and the leaves
should be sprayed occasionally with
clear water. They are subject to red
spider, so watch for this pest. Spraying
the leaves is a preventive measure.
Since azaleas like acid soil,
they seem to benefit from an occasional
watering with a solution of a
teaspoon of vinegar to a quart of
water. In the summer the pot may
be sunk in the soil in the shade and
returned to the house in the autumn.
With good care, your azalea should
bloom again and can be maintained
for a long time.</p>
<p class="revint">Question: My neighbor uses the
branches from her Christmas tree
as a mulch on her tulip bed. Is this
a good idea?</p>
<p class="revint">Answer: Yes, branches from the
Christmas tree make a good mulch
for the tulip bed. They keep the
soil from warming up too early, resulting
in too quick growth and loss
of bloom. They are useful for
mulching perennial beds, too.</p>

Council of State Garden Clubs, is now working on the support and endowment
of the permanent home of the National Council of State Garden Clubs, in St.

Club donate one dollar ($1.00) a year to the home, so that in four, or five
years, the interest from this fund would completely cover the maintenance costs
of this worthy project. Let&rsquo;s do some serious thinking regarding this suggestion.</p>

Convention of Garden Clubs held in their city September 29, 30, and October
1. The many thoughtful services, recognition of those who have long given
of their time and ability without reward or favor, beautifully planned decorations
and souvenirs, as well as the Convention planning itself, was done in
such a fine way that those who were forced to cancel their reservations felt
deprived of a special experience in Garden Club Conventions. Please take a
bow, all you wonderful Idaho Springs Garden Clubbers.</p>

<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">IN APPRECIATION OF RAY T. MILLER</span></h2>
<p class="center">By <span class="sc">M. Walter Pesman</span></p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11a.jpg" alt="Ray T. Miller" width="500" height="606" />
</div>
<p>You could always depend on Ray
Miller! We hear a great deal these
days of &ldquo;featherbedding&rdquo;, and we
have seen some of it ourselves. I
could only wish that those who are
suspicious,&mdash;and the guilty ones as
well, could have known Ray in his
work, and in his attitude. He would
always do his job well and conscientiously.
Many of his horticultural accomplishments
bear witness to his
thorough way of doing things.</p>
<p>I first knew him as superintendent
of Berkeley Park, at that time one of
the outlying parks. He carried out
many of the improvements planned
by the newly appointed Parks landscape
architect, S. R. DeBoer. Both
worked together for at least thirty
years on the Denver Park System. Ray
became superintendent of City Park,
later he was in charge of the western
division of all city parks. Whatever
job was given him to do, everybody
knew it was going to be done promptly
and properly, and with full knowledge
of our unusual conditions of Rocky
Mountain horticulture.</p>
<p>He became an expert on transplanting
and on collecting native plant material.
He&rsquo;d always do just a little
more than might be reasonably expected
of him.</p>
<p>Born in Springfield, Kansas, he
moved to Denver in 1905 at the age
of twenty-six. His was a happy family.
The two sons soon made a place for
themselves, even if they did not remain
with horticulture. His wife was
active in many civic affairs.</p>
<p>When the Roadside Development
program was initiated in Colorado,
both Mr. Vail, the Highway engineer,
and I, as landscape engineer, wanted
Ray to take an active part as foreman
and supervisor on the new jobs; a
man was needed here who was familiar
with nursery stock, including native
plants, who could read blueprints with
full understanding of what was planned,
and who could deal with the public
in many ways. Highway engineers
are not always familiar with plants
and their requirements. People adjoining
roadside projects could not always
see why they should cooperate in giving
easements. Nursery contractors
needed to be shown that the State
Highways wanted to be fair and live
up to specifications.</p>
<p>The new landscape supervisor soon
showed that he could make friends
with all, and gain their respect and
understanding.</p>
<p>At times he had to carry out certain
plans and specifications with his
own crew. I remember one particular
job in which he superintended the collecting,
balling and burlapping of over
a hundred rather large ponderosa
pines in the midst of winter. They
were planted just north of the Blakeland
<span class="pb" id="Page_352">352</span>
underpass: only one or two failed
to survive the difficult ordeal. To this
day they bear witness to his skill and
know-how.</p>
<p>After the roadside program was discontinued,
due to the war, Mr. Miller
was wanted at various jobs where his
skills, horticultural knowledge, and his
enormous capacity for work were
needed.</p>
<p>Not until recently was he willing to
concede that a man approaching eighty
ought not to attempt the physical labors
of a younger man. Even then,
he went on an arduous fishing trip
after being an octogenarian!</p>
<p>To many of us, interested in horticulture,
Ray Miller represents a symbol.
If only we could train a hundred
men in his attitude and pass on to
them his knowledge of practical plant
methods, we&rsquo;d feel safer about the
future of horticulture in the Rocky
Mountain region. He has made a
place in Denver and Colorado for
himself, that will survive, and that
will serve as an inspiration for all of
us who strive for the best in horticulture.</p>

<p>Preliminary plans and drawings
for the Spring Garden Show
have been accepted by the Show committee.
From the preview of these
plans it is easy to see that the residents
of this area are in for a garden extravaganza
second to none. The committee
has accomplished the basic ground
work for this spectacular show and is
now ready to proceed with the additional
planning and staging necessary
to make it a reality in April.</p>

<p>Featuring today&rsquo;s outdoor living,
this show promises to be a great boon
to gardening in the Rocky Mountains.
Its success depends on the enthusiasm
and cooperation of all the various gardening
groups in the area. Your Association,
confident of its success and
recognizing its great educational value,
is co-sponsoring this show with the
Botanic Gardens. We urge you, as a

<img src="images/p12a.jpg" alt="MERRY CHRISTMAS &middot; CHRISTMAS GIFTS &middot; WINTER READING &middot; FOR THE BIRDS" width="468" height="940" />
</div>
<p>This is the month of Evergreens. Their color
and place in the landscape bridge the winter gap
between summer and spring. At this season they
are not only the dominant feature in the garden,
but in the home as well, when they stand bedecked
with tinsel and lights at Christmas. This is their
shining hour. Theirs is the symbol of Christmas.</p>
<p>It is also a time for gardeners to relax, that
is if you haven&rsquo;t forgotten to hill up your roses or
haven&rsquo;t had time to plant your spring flowering
bulbs. Of course, Christmas preparations will take
up some of the slack time, but a good gardener
should find some time for reading, now and in the
wintery months ahead. This is a gentle reminder
that, as a member of the Association, you have
lending privileges at the Helen Fowler Library at
909 York Street. This excellent library contains
a great many books on all phases of gardening,
and is open Monday through Friday from 8:30
a.m. to 5 p.m. Whether you are interested in roses
or iris, bugs or plant diseases, landscaping or rock
gardens, you will find an appropriate book in our
library.</p>
<p>To make your Christmas shopping easier,
here are a few suggestions for your gardening
friends. &ldquo;The Green Thumb,&rdquo; itself, makes an
excellent gift for the new home owner or novice
gardener. Just use the gift blank on <a href="#Page_350">page 350</a> in
this magazine. Good books on gardening, such as
George Kelly&rsquo;s &ldquo;Good Gardens in the Sunshine
States&rdquo;, are welcome gifts. Your local garden shop
is well stocked with tools and gimmicks that will
make a hit with the weekend gardener. For the
hard-to-please you will find gift certificates available
at most of the nurseries and garden centers.</p>
<p>House plants become more noticeable and attractive
now that outdoor plants have faded from
the limelight. Like the plants in our gardens, they
need some attention if they are to perform well.
The addition, about once a month, of a soluble
fertilizer to their water will take care of their mineral
requirements. Check them occasionally for
aphids and mealy bugs. If only a few are present,
they can be removed with a cotton swab and alcohol.
However if there is a heavy infestation, take
them outside on a warm day (60-70&deg;) and spray
with malathion. Frequent syringing or spraying of
the foliage is beneficial to most house plants. Take
care not to overwater plants in ceramic or plastic
<span class="pb" id="Page_354">354</span>
containers without drainage. Small quantities of
charcoal in the bottom of such containers helps
keep the soil sweet.</p>
<p>While many of our birds have gone south for
the winter, we find that many have taken up winter
quarters here. When the weather is good, they
seem to forage pretty well for themselves, but when
snow covers the ground they are often hard pressed
for food. Set up a bird feeding station in your yard
and enjoy the antics of the different feathered
personalities who come to take advantage of your
winter hospitality. Some of the foods recommended
for such a feeding station are: suet and fatty
trimmings from meat; seeds of sunflower, pumpkin,
millet, rye, barley, wheat, and numerous weed
seeds. Most of the garden shops now carry mixed
seeds for wild birds. In addition bread crumbs,
popcorn, and nuts are welcome tidbits for the birds.
Once you start a feeding station keep it filled. Birds
learn to rely on finding food there and will suffer
when you neglect it.</p>
<p>One word in regard to the weather, if it should
stay dry for any long period of time, 3 to 4 weeks,
get out the hose and give everything, particularly
the evergreens, a good soaking.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year&mdash;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
